JavaScript operators are special symbols used toperform operations on operands (values and variables). Operators are used to manipulate data 
and variables, making them a fundamental part of JavaScript programming.

Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations:

Addition (+)
Subtraction (-)
Multiplication (*)
Division (/)
Modulus (%)
Exponentiation (**)
Increment (++)
Decrement (--)

Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values:

Equal to (==)
Not equal to (!=)
Strict equal to (===)
Strict not equal to (!==)
Greater than (>)
Greater than or equal to (>=)
Less than (<)
Less than or equal to (<=)

Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine multiple boolean expressions:

Logical AND (&&)
Logical OR (||)
Logical NOT (!)

The ternary operator in JavaScript is a concise way to perform
conditional operations. It's also known as the conditional operator. The ternary operator takes 
three operands, which is why it's called "ternary."

Assignment operators in JavaScript are used to assign values to variables. They are essential for initializing 
and updating variables. The most common assignment operator is the simple assignment operator =, but there are
several other compound assignment operators that combine arithmetic or bitwise operations with assignment.
